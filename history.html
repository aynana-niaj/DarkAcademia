            <br><h1 class="headings">Historic Influence on Aesthetics</h1><br>
            <p>
                Romanticizing the university experience and idealizing the process of gaining knowledge is the most common motif.  Studying is done for the enjoyment of it, both in connection to the subject itself, but also as a picturesque thing for a person to do. Many people join Dark Academia to motivate themselves in their schoolwork, as beauty is a good motivator to study.
            </p>
            <p>
                Autumn is also a popular theme under this subculture. Images of Gothic and Collegiate buildings, candles, dark wooden furniture, and cramped chambers appear. The terms Maximalist and nostalgic can be used to describe this aesthetic.
            </p>
            <p>
                The aesthetic is heavily influenced by the 1940s fashion, attire worn by students at Oxbridge, Ivy League colleges, and prep schools. One writer compared it to the contemporary cottagecore lifestyle, saying that while cottagecore requires a home in the country and leisure time for crafting, dark academia's "simple act of putting on a blazer and reading Dostoevsky is far more doable.

            <h1 class="subheadings">The Backstory</h1>
            <p>
                Donna Tartt's novel The Secret History, published in 1992 and which tells the story of a murder that takes place within a group of classics students at an elite New England college, has been credited as being the inspiration for the dark academia literary genre. In 2015, the genre began to grow into an aesthetic on social media site Tumblr, with the creation of a book club that centered around classic and gothic novels. The aesthetic then grew into a distinct subculture, seeing a wave of popularisation on Instagram led by Ryan Taylor and Maria Teresa Negro in 2017.

            <h1 class="subheadings">Rise in Popularity</h1>
            <p>
                A rise in popularity of dark academia during the COVID-19 pandemic has been credited to the shutdown of schools. Some commentators have attributed the rise in popularity of the subculture as a reaction to cuts to university funding and the corporatisation of higher education. Honi Soit writer Ezara Norton stated that it "reveals a deep disillusionment with [education models that devalue knowledge unless it can be used to generate profit, and a longing for a space free to learn unencumbered by a neoliberal agenda."
